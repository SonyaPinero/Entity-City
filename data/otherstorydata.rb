"The Morris-Jumel Mansion"

"One of the oldest houses in Manhattan, this stately Georgian mansion in Washington Heights was built by Roger Morris—a colonel in the British army—in 1765. It served as military headquarters for both sides of the Revolution, with George Washington retreating here after the disastrous loss of the Battle of Brooklyn in 1776. In 1810, the house was bought by Stephen Jumel and his wife Eliza, and after his suspicious death, she remarried in 1832 to a haunted figure in his own right: Aaron Burr, the former Vice President and killer of Alexander Hamilton. Since at least the 1960s, rumors of the supernatural have persisted, when a group of rowdy schoolchildren allegedly saw the ghostly visage of Eliza Jumel, who told them to quiet down before gliding away. Other sightings include a talking grandfather clock and a Hessian soldier who’s been known to emerge from paintings on the wall, Hogwarts-style."

"The Dakota"
			
"The Dakota is renowned for its featured role in Roman Polanski’s 1968 horror classic Rosemary’s Baby and as the site of John Lennon’s assassination, but the legendary Central Park West building has a long history of supernatural encounters in its own right. Over the years, workers and residents have reported seeing a friendly little girl dressed in turn-of-the-century clothing, an adult with the face of a small boy, and even the ghost of Lennon himself."

"57 West 57th Street"

"In 1922, Albert Champion, a former cyclist and inventor of the spark plug, married showgirl Edna Crawford. The May-September romance quickly soured when Edna took the younger, dashing Frenchman Charles Brazelle as a lover. In 1927, Brazelle allegedly murdered Champion in a Paris hotel, but Edna and Brazelle convinced authorities he died of a “weak heart” and were set to inherit his fortune, with which she and Brazelle bought the penthouse at 57 West 57th Street. Brazelle was jealous, keeping Edna a prisoner of the penthouse and eventually beating her to death with a telephone, after which her bodyguards threw him out the window. The penthouse lay vacant for years, but subsequent owner Carlton Alsop claimed to hear Edna’s clicking high heels and the couple’s violent arguments, and his guests often reported seeing horrific, unexplainable sights. His wife left him, his dogs had nervous breakdowns, and things got so bad for Alsop that he eventually had himself committed, before abandoning the penthouse forever."

"The Campbell Apartment"

"A few years ago, our friends at Eater reported on the supposed haunting of The Campbell Apartment—the lavishly appointed cocktail lounge in Grand Central Terminal, which was once the office and salon of financier John W. Campbell, who died in 1957. According to owner Mark Grossich, employees have felt strange presences, including something pushing them from behind and bursts of cold air, and some have even reported seeing “an old, fashionably dressed couple sitting and having a cocktail on the balcony when the place was completely closed.”"

"15 Vanderbilt Avenue, New York, NY 10017"

"The House of Death"

"This beautiful townhouse on quiet West 10th has been called the most haunted building in New York, with as many as twenty-two ghosts calling it home, earning 14 West 10th Street the sobriquet “The House of Death.” Mark Twain lived here from 1900 to 1901 and claimed that he himself had experienced supernatural incidents. Throughout the twentieth century, 14 West 10th was the site of several gruesome incidents, including a murder-suicide and the beating death of six-year-old Lisa Steinberg at the hands of her adopted father, prominent attorney Joel Steinberg, in 1987. The specter of Twain himself—white suit and all—has been seen ascending the staircase."

"12 Gay Street"

"Located right around the corner from bustling Sixth Avenue, Gay Street is arguably one of the most picturesque blocks in New York, and the quaint brick townhouse at number 12 is no exception. The building served as a speakeasy called The Pirate’s Den during Prohibition and was purchased by the corrupt (yet wildly popular) Mayor Jimmy Walker as a home for his mistress, Ziegfeld girl Betty Compton. Neighbors insist that ghostly flappers and the Gay Street Phantom—a dapper gent in a cloak and top hat—still lurk around late at night, and if that’s not creepy enough, the property was later bought by Frank Paris, the creator of notorious hell-puppet Howdy Doody."

"St. Mark's Church in-the-Bowery"

"St. Mark’s Chruch in-the-Bowery is the second-oldest church in Manhattan, splitting from Trinity Church in 1799. Built on Dutch colonial governor Peter Stuyvesant’s family farm, legend has it that the cantankerous, peg-legged Dutchman still haunts the area. He’s been known to harass clergymen and parishioners, ring the bells, and loudly interrupt services by stomping around and singing Calvinist hymns in Dutch. Apparently, English Episcopal hymns simply don’t agree with him."

"The Merchant's House"

"While some haunted houses might attempt to shed their notorious reputations, the East Village Merchant’s House Museum all but relishes it. Built in 1832 and later bought by wealthy merchant Seabury Tredwell, the museum is an immaculate look into the personal domestic lives of the nineteenth-century cultural elite, but the ghost of Tredwell’s daughter, Gertrude—a lonely, sheltered spinster whose life was supposedly the basis of Henry James’ Washington Square Park—still haunts the place."

"29 East 4th Street, New York, NY 10003"

"The Manhattan Well"

"In the winter of 1800, the body of a young woman named Gulielma Sands was found at the bottom of the Manhattan Well at what is now 129 Spring Street. The ensuing trial was one of the great scandals of nineteenth century New York, with Levi Weeks (brother of influential builder Ezra Weeks)accused of her murder after he reportedly impregnated and promised to marry her.  Weeks retained the city’s top attorneys (including Aaron Burr and Alexander Hamilton) and was acquitted, despite growing public outrage. In 1817, the Manhattan Well was filled in and built over, but it was rediscovered in 1980 and has since become a notorious destination for paranormal enthusiasts claiming that the ghost of Gulielma Sands still haunts the area."

"85 West 3rd Street"

"Now part of NYU’s Furman Hall, 85 West 3rd Street was once occupied by Edgar Allen Poe for eight months in 1844 and 1845, where he wrote his classic story 'The Cask of Amontillado' and at least part of 'The Raven.'' Nowadays, the only part of the original residence that remains is the banister and Poe’s ghost has been seen climbing it by spooked law students."

"Jefferson Market Library"

"Built originally to serve as a fire tower lookout in 1833, this building was expanded to serve as a courthouse in 1877. It was also the location for New York City's first night court due to its central location in the city's entertainment district at the time. This also caused it to expand its use yet again as a woman's prison as many of the defendants being prosecuted at the night court were prostitutes. It was also home to New York's most infamous court case in which Harry Kendall Thaw was acquitted of the murder of world renowned architect Sanford White by reason of insanity. While no specific ghost haunts this particular location, people have seen figures at night up in the top of the bell tower that is closed year round to the public. This location has also been home to female apparitions, which are known to roam the small park that used to be the location of the female only prison."

"White Horse Tavern"

"Opened as a bar in 1880, this drinking hole was known as a longshoreman's bar until the 1960's when famous writers began to call this place home. Famous regulars to this drinking pub included Bob Dylan, Hunter S. Thompson, and Jim Morrison. Yet its most famous patron was that of Dylan Thomas who often drank heavily at this location and was the bar that he drank at before his death. He famously said of the bar shortly before his death, 'I've had 18 straight whiskies. I think that's the record!'. While not the prevailing cause of his parting, the rumor that Dylan Thomas drank himself to death at the White Horse is well known and often believed. This has not stopped his ghost from continuing to haunt his favorite watering hole even after his passing. His ghost is said to move things around in the bar as well as having been seen drinking at his favorite table before quickly disappearing. The bar helps keep his legacy alive and well by keeping a massive portrait hanging in the middle of the bar."

	"New Amsterdam Theatre"

"On September 10, 1920, actress Olive Thomas stumbled out of the bathroom of a Parisian hotel, horrified by what she'd done, having accidentally ingested an entire bottle of mercury bichloride pills. The dose, prescribed to her philandering husband Jack Pickford for his syphilis, was lethal. The couple was vacationing in Paris at the time on a second honeymoon, and their trip was tragically cut short. Lucky for New York, Thomas's ghost crossed the Atlantic so that she could haunt the New Amsterdam, where she once acted. Workers and security guards have claimed to see Thomas walking backstage and throughout the halls of the theater, clutching a blue bottle of pills. Thomas often appears to men—is there a more uncomfortable situation than being hit on by a ghost?—though her spirit reacts calmly as long as she's approached genially."

	"Belasco Theatre"

	"Owner David Belasco used to live in an apartment above the theatre with his companion, referred to as 'the Blue Lady,' until his death in 1931. According to some individuals, however, Belasco's spirit has never left the confines of the theatre, and he and the Blue Lady have reportedly been seen onstage during performances, in the audience, and in the elevator. After Oh! Calcutta! came to the Belasco in 1971, however, Belasco's ghost was never seen again. The play is notable for it's sexual themes and frontal male and female nudity; obviously, Belasco was just a total prude."

"Hotel Chelsea"

"The Hotel Chelsea has a storied past, and has been a frequented by the likes of the many celebrities, including Patti Smith, Bob Dylan, Jimi Hendrix, and Andy Warhol. However, its legacy is just as ugly as it is star-studded. The Chelsea has been the site of several infamous celebrity deaths, specifically those of poet/writer Dylan Thomas and Sid Vicious' girlfriend Nancy Spungen. Spungen was found dead in a hotel room with Sid Vicious, and he was summarily arrested for her murder. He overdosed on heroin before he could stand trial, and it is said that the ghosts of the lovers haunt the floors. Sweet, right? Thomas, a famous alcoholic, appears near room 206, the very place he died in 1953."

"St. Paul's Chapel"

"St. Paul's chapel, New York's oldest public building still in use, is the final resting place for famed (and notoriously hard-drinking) British actor George Frederick Cooke. In addition to his alcoholism, Cooke was prone to extravagant spending, which led to a mountain of debt. To settle it, Cooke decided that his head would be donated to science after he died. When he did, in 1812, his corpse was decapitated and his tortured soul has reportedly been seen drifting among the cemetery headstones searching for his missing head. Fun fact: His skull was used as a theater prop in Hamlet productions. Even in death, he stayed ahead in his craft."

 "One If by Land, Two If by Sea"

 "Paranormal activity isn't often a precursor to romance, but at classic NYC eatery One If by Land, Two If by Sea, you can enjoy both in tandem. The restaurant was once the carriage house of Alexander Hamilton and his daughter Theodosia, and their spirits still creep around the house. Staff members and diners alike have reported strange incidents, including lights flickering, patrons being shoved by spirits, and the earrings of women sitting at the bar repeatedly disappearing. The staff claims the spirits are benevolent, but if we're paying $20 for a bowl of soup, we'd prefer it not come with a side of poltergeist."

 "17 Barrow St, New York, NY 10014"

 "Algonquin Hotel"

"Built in 1902, the Algonquin developed a reputation as a salon for artists and writers, and is known for the Round Table Group who met daily in the 1930s. The group included Dorothy Parker, George Kaufman, Harpo Marx, Robert Benchley and Marc Connelly. Members of the wait staff and patrons of the restaurant have reported seeing their ghosts over the years and have claimed to hear their footsteps."

 "Chumley’s (Now Closed)"

 "Known for its supernatural history, this West Village pub closed in 2007 when the chimney in the dining room collapsed. Perhaps this makes it easier for the former speakeasy’s resident ghost to swing by without being noticed. The spirit of former bar mistress and owner, Henrieta Chumley, has been said to occasionally visit for a drink. She is also known to play the jukebox, even when it is unplugged."
